# Hi! I'm TwinDragon, aka. TwinShadow!

Some quick notes about me and what I do, because I'm not much of a coder. lol...

Let's start with my name, Ryan. I can understand a tiny bit of code, but I could never write something from scratch. I used to do basic HTML/CSS stuff back in the day, but now I don't and stick to more practical skills. Below, you'll find a more detail list of my interests.

## Discord Stuff

I run around on Discord as *TwinShadow#0666* and can find me on a few servers. I run a bot called [Fennec-san][discord], which I tuned to be more anime-centric as well as having strong moderation features and other tools to help me with some servers I manage.

As *Fennec-san* is a semi-public bot, I'm only allowing some people to invite her into servers. If you wish to inquire further about her and if you've look at her dashboard, feel free to join [Fox Bot Emporium][discord]. Just be prepared to answer a couple minor questions before having your guild whitelisted.
